### Single Layer neural network  
Single Layer neural network's performence is not so good.  
Which have accuracy of 55% on CIFAR-10  
However, with PCAwhintening and Kmeans, it can reach 75% on CIFAR-10  
Detailed report is in mp1.pdf  
I re-create and modified the model in the following paper:  
["Analysis Single Layer Unsupervised Feature Learning"](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nipsdlufl10-AnalysisSingleLayerUnsupervisedFeatureLearning.pdf)
